## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  - Documentation and diagramming was done very accurately. We're proud of the results and will
  ensure a smooth transition from the planning and modelling stage into the construction and testing
  stages of development.
  - Team members were responsive and put in the work to ensure deadlines were met. We're flexible
  with meeting times and available for extra meetings to accommodate project needs.
  - Criticism was never taken negatively and there wasn't an issue with constructive criticism being
  taken the wrong way.
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
  - An issue that came up was the disconnect between the class and the project. We aim to follow the
  class' content more closely to minimize the risk of missing details.
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
  - Watching the class videos consistently each week is the first step to fixing the problem we
  encountered.
