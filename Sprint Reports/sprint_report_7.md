## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * The Poster Presentation went very smoothly
  * The Client Presentation was well received
  * Codebase is finished and meets client's requirements
  * Documentation is finished and meets client's requirements
  
Here's what we'd like to improve (theoretically):
   * Future work section would have been nice to have had some members completed, however with the time constraints and setbacks, this is the best result.
