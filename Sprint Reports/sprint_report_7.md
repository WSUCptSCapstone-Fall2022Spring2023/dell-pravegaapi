# Sprint x Report (4/2/23 - 5/2/2023)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * Feature 1 Rework of GitHub structure
 * Feature 2 Finished working on the Byte module
 * Feature 3 Implemented the event_writer functions

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During this sprint we finsihed implementing the Byte module, and wrote the code for the event_writer object. We also reorganized the repo so that it is easier to understand, and so that the Rust code can access a singular ClientFactory stored in OnceCell.

## Unfinished Work
We were unable to finish certain parts of the Event module as well as the remaining modules that were our goals at the beginning of the semester. Event is acceptably complete. We were also unable to implement read/write locks, improve timing, and error logging. This was due to the fact that making Async work took the majority of our time, and a major breakthrouhg was only discovered a couple of weeks before the end of the semester.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * The Poster Presentation went very smoothly
  * The Client Presentation was well received
  * Codebase is finished and meets client's requirements
  * Documentation is finished and meets client's requirements
  
Here's what we'd like to improve (theoretically):
   * Future work section would have been nice to have had some members completed, however with the time constraints and setbacks, this is the best result.
