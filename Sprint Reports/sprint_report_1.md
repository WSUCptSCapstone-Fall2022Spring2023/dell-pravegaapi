## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
  Much of the work that was completed for this sprint is preliminary work intended to facilitate future development. The most worked on part of this sprint was getting drafts done for the sections "Project Description", "Requirements and Specifications", and solutions approach for the final report. The GitHub Repo was also set up. It currently holds the video and report for Sprint 1, the documents for the final report, and skeleton test code using Interoptopus, an open source program that creates C# wrappers for Rust code.

## Unfinished Work

For issues/user stories in the current sprint that have not been closed, (a) any progress toward completion of the issues has been clearly tracked (by checking the checkboxes of  acceptance criteria), (b) a comment has been added to the issue to explain why the issue could not be completed (e.g., "we ran out of time" or "we did not anticipate it would be so much work"), and (c) the issue is added to a subsequent sprint, so that it can be addressed later.
