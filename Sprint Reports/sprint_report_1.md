# Sprint x Report (8/26/21 - 9/24/2021)

## What's New (User Facing)
 * No User Features Implemented at this time

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
  Much of the work that was completed for this sprint is preliminary work intended to facilitate future development. The most worked on part of this sprint was getting drafts done for the sections "Project Description", "Requirements and Specifications", and solutions approach for the final report. The GitHub Repo was also set up. It currently holds the video and report for Sprint 1, the documents for the final report, and skeleton test code using Interoptopus, an open source program that creates C# wrappers for Rust code.

## Unfinished Work
If applicable, explain the work you did not finish in this sprint. For issues/user stories in the current sprint that have not been closed, (a) any progress toward completion of the issues has been clearly tracked (by checking the checkboxes of  acceptance criteria), (b) a comment has been added to the issue to explain why the issue could not be completed (e.g., "we ran out of time" or "we did not anticipate it would be so much work"), and (c) the issue is added to a subsequent sprint, so that it can be addressed later.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  - Documentation and diagramming was done very accurately. We're proud of the results and will
  ensure a smooth transition from the planning and modelling stage into the construction and testing
  stages of development.
  - Team members were responsive and put in the work to ensure deadlines were met. We're flexible
  with meeting times and available for extra meetings to accommodate project needs.
  - Criticism was never taken negatively and there wasn't an issue with constructive criticism being
  taken the wrong way.
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
  - An issue that came up was the disconnect between the class and the project. We aim to follow the
  class' content more closely to minimize the risk of missing details.
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
  - Watching the class videos consistently each week is the first step to fixing the problem we
  encountered.
