## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
Provide a one paragraph synposis of what your team accomplished this sprint. Don't repeat the "What's New" list of features. Instead, help the instructor understand how you went about the work described there, any barriers you overcame, and any significant learnings for your team.

## Unfinished Work
If applicable, explain the work you did not finish in this sprint. For issues/user stories in the current sprint that have not been closed, (a) any progress toward completion of the issues has been clearly tracked (by checking the checkboxes of  acceptance criteria), (b) a comment has been added to the issue to explain why the issue could not be completed (e.g., "we ran out of time" or "we did not anticipate it would be so much work"), and (c) the issue is added to a subsequent sprint, so that it can be addressed later.

## Completed Issues/User Stories
Here are links to the issues that we completed in this sprint:

 * URL of issue 1
 * URL of issue 2
 * URL of issue n

 Reminders (Remove this section when you save the file):
  * Each issue should be assigned to a milestone
  * Each completed issue should be assigned to a pull request
  * Each completed pull request should include a link to a "Before and After" video
  * All team members who contributed to the issue should be assigned to it on GitHub
  * Each issue should be assigned story points using a label
  * Story points contribution of each team member should be indicated in a comment
 
 ## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
 Here are links to issues we worked on but did not complete in this sprint:
 
 * URL of issue 1 <<One sentence explanation of why issue was not completed>>
 * URL of issue 2 <<One sentence explanation of why issue was not completed>>
 * URL of issue n <<One sentence explanation of why issue was not completed>>
 
 Examples of explanations (Remove this section when you save the file):
  * "We ran into a complication we did not anticipate (explain briefly)." 
  * "We decided that the feature did not add sufficient value for us to work on it in this sprint (explain briefly)."

## Retrospective 
Here's what went well:
  * 1) Staying on top of documentation deadlines
  * 2) Honesty about workload and what each individual is doing
  * 3) Stayed up to date with class content
  * 4) Good communication
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
   * 1) Staying on top of testing and code deadlines set by the group.
   * 2) Asking the Dell team more questions on Slack as they appear
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
   * 1) It is up to the individual to plan ahead when their schedule becomes busy to work on code beforehand so that other work does not get in the way of this project.
   * 2) Remind eachother of questions to ask on Slack if it was talked about in a meeting before and keep questions for Zoom meetings in a question backlog for the Dell team.
