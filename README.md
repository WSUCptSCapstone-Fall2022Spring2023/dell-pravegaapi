# Project Name
Dell Pravega C# API
## Project summary

### One-sentence description of the project

This project holds a C# library for using the Pravega data management system created by Dell.

### Additional information about the project

Pravega is an open-source storage system implemented and led by Dell Technologies. It uses Streams as a first-class primitive which are based on the append-only log data structure. They are flexible and have good performance. By implementing clients for Pravega in multiple languages, its use can expand to a variety of applications. It currently has clients in Java, Rust, and Python. It does not currently have a client for the .NET framework written in C#. The goal of this project is to create a C# wrapper in the hopes of implementing Pravega in one of the most used frameworks in the world.

### Prerequisites

The user should have the most current version of .NET installed on their system. 
### Add-ons

Interoptopus: Interoptopus is a program that was developed to facilitate the wrapping of Rust Code in C#. It is included currently for quick access while developing the project.

Pravega Rust Api: The original Rust code will be present for the wrapper to be able to call to. 

### Installation Steps

Currently, there is only skeleton test code for wrapping Rust code in C#. The installation should be relatively simple, however. The user will git clone the project, and then move into a folder with their source code. Then the user will have to add a reference to the .DLL containing the wrapper.
'git clone https://github.com/WSUCptSCapstone-Fall2022Spring2023/dell-pravegaapi.git'


## Functionality

Currently only test code wrapping Rust in C# has been implemented. The funcitonality of the final product should be no different than native C# code. A user should be able to include the library, and then call functions just like they would any other library. Maintaining standard C# usage is a key priority of this project.


## Known Problems
