Pre: pub(crate) functions very similarly to "internal" and as such it is expected that
an object with pub(crate) transferred over from Rust to C# will have the "internal"
attribute placed on it. If not, this is a quick fix in production.

Post: pub(crate) unfortunately does not transfer over, but as mentioned this is a quick
fix as "internal" or another attribute can be added such that it is visible only within
the .dll or as the functionality is needed.
