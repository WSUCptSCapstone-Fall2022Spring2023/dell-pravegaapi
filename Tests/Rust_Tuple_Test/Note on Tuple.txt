Pre: Attempt to move over function that returns a tuple and has a
tuple as an input from Rust to C#.

Post: Looking into this further and upon realization, tuples are
not a type of object in C and therefore aren't supported in FFI for
C. Luckily, it is a case where C doesn't have a feature, but Rust
and C# do. Therefore, for the future it should be noted that whenever
a function needs a tuple in Rust, it needs to be implemented in C#
manually using C# tuples.
