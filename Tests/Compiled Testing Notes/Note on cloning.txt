Pre: This sample shows how clone can transfer over from Rust to C#.
C# already has the clone function inheritable for objects and Rust
has something similar. This is to see how Rust's clone trait transfers
to C#.

Post: If an object is tagged with the "Clone" trait, the "Clone" will 
not be transferred over as C#'s outdated "Clone" in C#. Therefore, a
deep clone method is needed and the object needs to be serializeable.

Answer: Added Clone static function that recursively clones properties
of any object using system.reflection. Located in Interop.cs. Works with 
ValueTypes and ReferenceTypes.
