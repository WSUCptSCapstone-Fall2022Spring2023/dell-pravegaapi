Answer: Because traits are non-transferrable, it goes to reason that a manual implementation is needed.
However, there is no easy or catch all way to define PartialEq and PartialOrd for all structs as what is
equal and what is greater than may have different definitions. PartialEq could mean all values are equal,
or it could mean that one specific value is equal to each other within an object. For the future, our C#
code will contain manual implementations of PartialEq and PartialOrd in something similar to an interface.
