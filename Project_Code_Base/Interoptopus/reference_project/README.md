A reference project for [Interoptopus](https://github.com/ralfbiedert/interoptopus).

This project tries to use every Interoptopus feature at least once.
When submitting new features or making changes to existing ones the types and functions in
here will ensure existing backends still work as expected.

Note, many items here are deliberately not documented as testing how and if documentation
is generated is part of the test.
